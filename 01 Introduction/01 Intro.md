# React JS - Definition and Interview Questions

## Definition

React JS is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building modern, dynamic, and interactive user interfaces (UI) for web applications. It follows a component-based architecture, enabling developers to create reusable UI components. React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance by efficiently updating and rendering components only when data changes.

**Key Features of React JS:**

* Component-Based Architecture
* Virtual DOM for High Performance
* One-Way Data Binding
* JSX (JavaScript XML) Syntax
* Reusable and Maintainable Code

## Important Interview Questions with Answers

### 1. What is React JS?

**Answer:** React JS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces with a component-based approach. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the view efficiently using a virtual DOM.

### 2. What are the advantages of using React?

**Answer:**

* Faster rendering using Virtual DOM
* Component-based architecture promotes reusability
* One-way data binding makes code predictable
* Easy to learn and maintain
* Strong community support

### 3. What is JSX?

**Answer:** JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript. React components often use JSX to define UI structure.

### 4. What is the Virtual DOM in React?

**Answer:** The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React updates the Virtual DOM first, compares it with the real DOM (diffing), and then updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM, improving performance.

### 5. What are React components?

**Answer:** Components are reusable pieces of UI in React. There are two types:

* **Functional Components:** Defined as JavaScript functions.
* **Class Components:** Defined using ES6 classes with state and lifecycle methods.

### 6. What is the difference between state and props?

**Answer:**

* **Props:** Read-only attributes passed from parent to child component.
* **State:** Local, mutable data managed within a component.

### 7. What is the difference between React and Angular?

**Answer:**

* React is a library; Angular is a framework.
* React uses Virtual DOM; Angular uses real DOM.
* React uses one-way data binding; Angular supports two-way data binding.

### 8. What are React hooks?

**Answer:** Hooks are functions introduced in React 16.8 that allow functional components to use state and lifecycle methods. Common hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, etc.

### 9. What is the purpose of keys in React?

**Answer:** Keys help React identify which items in a list have changed, been added, or removed. They improve rendering performance for dynamic lists.

### 10. Can you use React for mobile apps?

**Answer:** Yes, using **React Native**, which allows building cross-platform mobile applications with React principles.
