| Architecture      | Component-based                           | MVC (Model-View-Controller)      | Component-based           |
| DOM               | Virtual DOM                               | Real DOM (with change detection) | Virtual DOM               |
| Data Binding      | One-way                                   | Two-way                          | Two-way (with v-model)    |
| Language          | JavaScript/JSX                            | TypeScript                       | JavaScript/HTML templates |
| Learning Curve    | Moderate                                  | Steep                            | Easy to Moderate          |
| Community Support | Large                                     | Large                            | Growing                   |
| Performance       | High                                      | Moderate                         | High                      |
| Flexibility       | High (can integrate with other libraries) | Low (all-in-one framework)       | High                      |

### Key Differences

1. **React** is a library focusing on building UI components and offers flexibility to integrate other tools.
2. **Angular** is a full-fledged framework with built-in solutions like dependency injection, routing, and forms.
3. **Vue** is a lightweight framework with a gentle learning curve and can scale with ecosystem libraries.
